# how_is_traffic
This tool constantly scans for traffic and notifies user when traffic is not too bad.

You have to create private_settings.py with

    GOOGLE_KEY = # Obtain your key from google to access the API 
    LOCATION_FROM = #Will be used as origins in the morning and destination in the evening 
    LOCATION_TO = #Will be used as destination in the morning and origins in the evening
    
 #Edit:
     Google has removed the free usage (or the non-connected-credit-card usage), so this project is not updated anymore
